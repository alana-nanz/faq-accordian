## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

- This was my first Javascript project on my own, outside of my Javascript course through Skillcrush.

- Linear-gradient as the background
```css
body {
  background: linear-gradient(hsl(273, 75%, 66%), hsl(240, 73%, 65%));
}
```

- Relative vs. Absolute Images
```css
.image-container {
  width: 250px;
  position: relative;
}

.img-woman {
  position: absolute;
  top: -140px;
}

.img-diamond-mobile {
  position: absolute;
  top: -20px;
}
```
